                  <p>I had asked for CoffeeScript assignment help. The deadline was 3 Days. After making the payment, in 6 hours I got a response from them that the expert will not be able to complete the solution with A+ grade and I was disappointed. However, All Assignment Experts refunded my complete money and shared partial solution with me i.e. whatever was completed by the expert. So I worked on the partial solution myself and completed it within deadline. Thankfully the expert shared partial work free of cost and that too, 2.5 days before deadline, so I had enough time to take action myself. These guys are honest. But I would still like to rate them 3 as they did not complete my CoffeeScript </p>
